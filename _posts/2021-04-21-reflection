# Digital Frankenstein 

##It’s Alive! – The Creation of Digital Frankenstein 

Digital Frankenstein is my proposed digital humanities project, and it serves as an interactive website meant to further the understanding of Mary Shelley’s novel, Frankenstein. This was not my original choice for my project when we began the Grant Project. Initially, I had intended to complete a grant proposal on a digital map and interactive website on Colonial Williamsburg. After looking into it a bit, I realized that while I found Colonial Williamsburg interesting, I was unsure it would be an optimal choice for my project. What pushed me to change my mind and choose Digital Frankenstein was my ENGL 201 course. In the class, we read Shelley’s Frankenstein, and I absolutely loved the book. As I was struggling to begin my Grant Narrative on Colonial Williamsburg, I worked with Dr. Stover and made a new grant abstract: Digital Frankenstein.
