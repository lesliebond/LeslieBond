# Using Oxygen and “The Yellow Wall-paper"
For this assignment, I was given a portion of Charlotte Perkin Stetson’s manuscript of her short story “The Yellow Wall-paper” to analyze and markup. "The Yellow Wall-paper was written in 1892 as a critique on the treatment of women and their mental well-beings. My aim for the assignment was to code and markup pages 39-42 using Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) in Oxygen, which uses eXtensible Markup Language (XML).


## Step One: TEI on Paper
The initial step of the assignment was to annotate the document on google docs. This included locating specific things in the text such as page beginnings, paragraphs, em-dashes, quotations, marked up words, etc. My section contained mostly page breaks and paragraphs, but also had several instances of odd spacing, em-dashes, and replaced/underlined words. Initially this was a relief because I found the idea of coding annotations to be intimidating.

## Step Two: TEI on the Computer
After completing the annotations on Google Docs, the next step was to move the text into a TEI document in Oxygen. This step was where I began to feel uncomfortable with the project because I was overwhelmed with Oxygen at first. The objective was to turn the annotations into tags on the TEI document; the tags were conveniently provided by my professor prior to the assignment, which made the process much easier. Most of the tags I used were straightforward, such as **< p>< p >** for separating paragraphs or **< space/ >** for weird spacing in the manuscript. The only section I had minor difficulty with was marking up underlined words using the **< del rend="strikethrough"> </del >** tag, but it ended up being easy to figure out.

After marking up the text section by section, it was interesting to click the “*Author*” tab to be able to view the text from a web perspective rather than a coding one. It was also very helpful to be able to double check my work throughout the process and make sure the code was appearing correctly.

## Thoughts on Oxygen and XML
Going into the assignment, I was definitely intimidated by Oxygen and XML. The coding aspect of the program seemed daunting and complex despite reassurance from my professor. Once I sat down to begin, however, I found the program to be fairly straightforward and easy-to-use. My professor also uploaded a tutorial that was helpful in figuring out how to start. By the end of the project, the process seemed so easy that I was doubting I had done it correctly. After looking over it, however, the code was intact and there were no areas that appeared red. 

Technology (coding specifically) is not one of my strong suits, so naturally, I was worried right from the beginning. It ended up being far easier than I expected, and much to my surprise, I even found this assignment enjoyable! While I do not see myself utilizing Oxygen or XML for personal use in the future, I can definitely appreciate it as a beneficial skill to have.
