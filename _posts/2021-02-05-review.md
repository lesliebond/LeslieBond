## Summary / Purpose
*Visual Haggard* is a digital library and archive surrounding the works of English author Sir Henry Rider Haggard that was directed and edited by Joe Essey and Kate Holterhoff respectively. The archive consists of a large collection of Rider Haggard’s novels, as well as the extensive quantity of art that was illustrated to corollate alongside of his work. All 64 novels included on the website have links to alternate editions of each novel, if available. There are more the sixty illustrators featured with background information and their individual artwork for Rider Haggard's novels. 


## Relevance 
As a digital humanities (DH) project, *Visual Haggard* effectively utilizes digital components such as coordinated images and links to build an online library that is as interactive as it is educational. It was built using the code language HTML and JavaScript. Joe Essey and Kate Holterhoff both have experience working with their fields, software engineering and British literature, digital humanities, and visual culture respectively. Although it may not replace the intimacy of a physical library, it is an effective and convenient substitute.

## Design

The simplistic, straightforward appearance of *Visual Haggard* makes the archive easy to navigate, and links to other pages on the navigation bar (*Novels, Illustrators, Biography*, and *Editor’s Statement*) are clearly labeled to ensure little confusion as the reader explores the site. The illustrations on the site are all large enough that the reader can view them without having to click outside of the page that they are currently viewing.

The collection of Rider Haggard’s novels is stored under the *Novels* page, and the content is arranged in alphabetical order with illustrations of the title pages for each novel. By clicking on the title illustration, the reader is conveniently brought to a page with background information on that particular novel, as well as links to different editions available. These links provide the viewer with metadata on that specific edition, including publishing information and illustrations associated with that exact edition of the novel.

Similar to the Novels page, the *Illustrators* page is also in alphabetical order and provides an image of each illustrator's work for the viewer to click on to learn more information. One convenient feature of the *Illustrators* page is that it provides a complete list of all of the illustrators available with hyperlinks for easy navigation.

While the layout of the project is efficient and convenient, there is a lack of consistency with some of its features. The “further readings” sections, while helpful if the reader wants to find out more information, are inconsistent in providing hyperlinks to external sources, and the ones that do contain hyperlinks do not stand out and would be easy to overlook. Another lack of consistency was when they could not find any background information on the illustrators or specific editions of the novels. Some of them contained disclaimers for the lack of information, and others were left completely blank. 
The *Biography* page of the project is detailed and well-researched, providing extensive background information on Rider Haggard; however, the section can be difficult to read because the subheadings are the same size and font as the main text, giving off the appearance of one continuous piece of text without any breaks.

Overall, the project was well organized in both appearance and convenience. Although not mobile device friendly, it was easy to navigate and user friendly on a computer. It was pleasing to explore the website, and there was little frustration. *Visual Haggard* offers straightforward and generally trouble-free digital access to a wide variety of literature written by H. Rider Haggard. By interacting with the project, users of all different experience, knowledge, and background can browse and learn a substantial amount of information previously reserved for in-person interaction at a library all from the ease of their computer.
