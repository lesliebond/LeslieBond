My name is Leslie Bond, and my preferred pronouns are she/her. I am a sophomore here at Christopher Newport University. Prior to enrolling in *Writing for the Digital Humanities*, or *ENGL 350*, I knew next to nothing about the field. While also fulfilling a WI requirement, I know that *ENGL 350* will improve my writing skills. Due to the unique design and content of the course compared to typical English courses, *ENGL 350* will certainly urge me to step outside of my comfort zone. 

After graduating from Christopher Newport University with a double major in English and History, my intent is to begin working on my career, eventually leading to the publishing field. This course will be beneficial beyond publishing however, due to the increasingly technological career world we live in.

In high school, I completed volunteer work with Quantico Marine Corps Base Elementary Schools. While I did not complete extensive volunteer work my freshman year at Christopher Newport University, I recently joined the Theta Nu chapter of __Alpha Delta Pi__ with CNU and am beyond excited to begin volunteer work with the Ronald McDonald House Charities nonprofit organization. Joining Alpha Delta Pi will also be helpful in developing social skills and time management skills. My biggest personal accomplishment, aside from enrolling with Christopher Newport University, has been my academics in both my high school and college careers. In high school, I maintained honor roll status after completing most of a semester homebound (before homebound was normalcy) due to a spinal fusion surgery. Here at Christopher Newport University, I have also maintained my position on the Deanâ€™s List for all three of my semesters here.

Growing up, I was a part of a military family and moved around between North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and finally settled in Virginia. This experience helped me improve my social skills and made it easier for me to adapt to different social situations, which has also helped me in both my educational personal endeavors. I graduated from high school in Stafford, Virginia before coming to Christopher Newport University. One of the things I miss the most about being at home are my **nine** pets, including:
- Three horses
- Two dogs
- A cat
- Two goats
- A pig
My personal interests include a passion for coffee (I can be found studying at [Aroma's coffee](https://www.aromasworld.com/newportnewsloc) more often than not), interior design, hammocking, ~~traveling to new places~~ (traveling has unfortunaly become difficult due COIVD) and listening to music.
