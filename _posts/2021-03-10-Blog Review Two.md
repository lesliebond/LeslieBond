# Closet to Van Eyck

## Summary / Purpose

The digital humanities (DH) project, *Closer to Van Eyck*, explores an extensive collection of artworks painted by Jan van Eyck (ca. 1390-1441), a Belgian artist active during the Northern Renaissance period. The project, which is a part of the Van Eyck Research in OpeN Access (VERONA), is currently detailing the restoration of many of van Eyck’s works, most notably the Ghent Altarpiece, for Belgium’s cultural conservation. 

## Relevance
*Closer to Van Eyck* was created through Vrije Universiteit Brussel and an innovative interface that was created by Universum Digitalis using technologies through HTML5. The project is user-friendly on both desktop web-browsers and mobile devices. *Closer to Van Eyck* consists of a vast array of paintings, each one paired with the different steps in the restoration process; The Royal Institute for Culturally Heritage, which helps to document and conserve the cultural/artistic heritage of Belgium, was responsible for a lot of the digital restoration. Mimicking a digital art museum, it’s user-friendly design and development allow the viewer to immerse themselves in the history and art of Netherlandish culture. 

## Design
The practical design of *Closer to Van Eyck* makes it extremely user friendly, and it functions nearly just as well on a mobile device as it does on a desktop website. The home page is visually appealing to the eye, containing different paintings and cropped images painted van Eyck alternating in a sideshow. There are two main pages when the user is brought to the homepage (*The Ghent Altarpiece Restored* and *Further Works by Van Eyck*). If you click on the slideshow, two text-boxes pop-up, explaining what each page contains. While this is a helpful feature, I only found it by randomly clicking; it would be more straightforward if it was a permanent fixture on the homepage.
