# Closet to Van Eyck

## Summary / Purpose

The digital humanities (DH) project, *Closer to Van Eyck*, explores an extensive collection of artworks painted by Jan van Eyck (ca. 1390-1441), a Belgian artist active during the Northern Renaissance period. The project, which is a part of the Van Eyck Research in OpeN Access (VERONA), is currently detailing the restoration of many of van Eyck’s works, most notably the Ghent Altarpiece, for Belgium’s cultural conservation. 

## Relevance
*Closer to Van Eyck* was created through Vrije Universiteit Brussel and an innovative interface that was created by Universum Digitalis using technologies through HTML5. The project is user-friendly on both desktop web-browsers and mobile devices. *Closer to Van Eyck* consists of a vast array of paintings, each one paired with the different steps in the restoration process; The Royal Institute for Culturally Heritage, which helps to document and conserve the cultural/artistic heritage of Belgium, was responsible for a lot of the digital restoration. Mimicking a digital art museum, it’s user-friendly design and development allow the viewer to immerse themselves in the history and art of Netherlandish culture. 

## Design
The practical design of *Closer to Van Eyck* makes it extremely user friendly, and it functions nearly just as well on a mobile device as it does on a desktop website. The home page is visually appealing to the eye, containing different paintings and cropped images painted van Eyck alternating in a sideshow. There are two main pages when the user is brought to the homepage (*The Ghent Altarpiece Restored* and *Further Works by Van Eyck*). If you click on the slideshow, two text-boxes pop-up, explaining what each page contains. While this is a helpful feature, I only found it by randomly clicking; it would be more straightforward if it was a permanent fixture on the homepage.

Each of the pages on the website consists of a variety of very high-quality digital images of van Eyck’s paintings, and it is easy to zoom in and out in order to study them in more detail. Both pages also contain a side navigation bar that detail the restoration of the paintings: *Macrophotography, Infrared macrophotograph, Infrared reflectography*, and *X-radiography.* 

*The Ghent Altarpiece Restored* page is very straightforward as well, bringing the viewer to a digital version of the Ghent Altarpiece. From there, you can easily alternate throughout three sections (*Before, During*, and *After Restoration*) to compare the pieces throughout the process. Each individual painting is also clickable to be able to see it in more detail and compare different stages of the restoration side-by-side.

*Further works by van Eyck* brings the viewer to a beautifully done, digital map of Europe and the eastern United States. A large selection of van Eyck’s paintings are pinned to the map with red dots, which shows each of the paintings’ locations, and when clicked on, brings the viewer to background information on the location and restoration of that specific painting. The map is both easy to read and visually appealing; however, when trying to navigate around the map, it becomes confusing. For example, if you try to zoom in the paintings do not move, so you have to carefully track which line connects to the painting you are looking at. 

There is another section that allows the viewer to view the art on a digital “wall” if they choose. This tool is interesting because the paintings are scaled so that they can be compared in actual size. While this is convenient if you are just browsing the art, it does make it difficult to see the art clearly because many of them are small in size.

Despite extensive detail on the physical restoration process of the art, there is little information given beyond the name of the painting, when it was painted, and the restoration process. It would be useful to know the background of the art, such as where and why it was painted, who commissioned it, or any other interesting facts about it. 
Overall, however, *Closer to Van Eyck* is very well-organized and easy-to-use, making it an incredibly well-done DH project. It details the process of restoration and contains beautiful, high-quality digital copies of Jan van Eyck’s art, which is organized into appropriate sections and easily comparable. As an ongoing project, it is certain to help maintain the cultural heritage and history of Belgium and Jan van Eyck’s art.
